## 1st
Hi! 

Nice to meet you!
My name is Nadezda Tuzhilkina [pronounced Naděžda Tužilkina],
I'm a Graphic designer and Junior Art Director. And I am the mother of MORJ. 

In my professional work, I believe that Branding is like 'tailored' clothing. I work on projects individually, responding to unique client needs and characteristics. In my projects I enjoy doing strong research before taking action, it helps to find new unique ways to design and level the visual part of the work to a new level.

As my personal passion project, I draw MORJ (or Walrus) on Instagram (the.morj) every day. I started on the 5th of January in 2020 and from this day there is a new MORJ has been published, dedicated to various holidays, events, historical figures, individual countries, or everyday items. My favorite MORJ of the year 2023 was posted on the 2nd of May. Can you find it? 

What I can do: 
I can operate with OS - Windows, macOS
Working on graphics in Adobe Suite and Affinity Suite
Know how to create basic Animation on After Effect 
Working on projects with the team in Figma 
Getting used to Spline and other 3D programs 
Have some basic in Maya 3D 

I can speak Russian, Czech, and English. 

What I am like:  
Creative, responsible, organized, communicative, conflict-resolving

Between working at night and being a responsible student during the day, I enjoy drawing digitally or traditionally, depending on the moon phase. Also, you can find me spending my time at the gym and squatting 55 kg.  Or just read the manga.

Hi!
I'm Nadezda Tuzhilkina, but you can call me Naďa Tužilkina. I'm a Graphic designer and a Junior Art Director. I'm also the mother of MORJ!

What I am like during projects
I believe Branding is like 'tailored' clothing. Each project I take on is unique and tailored to match exactly what my clients need. Before diving into my projects, I love doing thorough research and analysis. It helps me come up with fresh, unique designs that take the visual aspect of my work to a whole new level.

What I can do:
I'm familiar with both Windows and macOS operating systems.
I work on graphics using Adobe Suite and Affinity Suite.
I know how to create basic animations using After Effects.
I collaborate with teams using Figma for projects.
I'm getting the hang of using Spline and other 3D programs.
I have some basic knowledge of Maya 3D.

I can speak Russian, Czech, and English fluently.

What I'm like as a person:
I'm creative, responsible, organized, communicative, and good at solving conflicts.

Project:
FOD
My thesis work for the DiS. diploma 
It took me 6 months
Goal of the project: Create a visual identity that helps the organization better present, increase public confidence, and find new ways of approaching donors.
Achievement: A successful presentation in front of the client (photo) 
What I learned: Good and thoughtful analysis helps a lot in creating identity. 

MamTe / teamwork / Albi 
Board game 
School final project of the year under the supervision of Martin Strnad
Teamwork with Helen Simonová, Adéla Koukalová a Margareta Verdyck
Goal of the project: Create a new board game with functional game rules and creative visuals. 
Achievement: Potential creating a real board game with the company ALBI
What I learned: Sometimes design itself is less important than being logical and entertaining. 

PFF 
The visual identity of the gastronomic festival in Prague 
Goal of the project: Adjust the visual according to the target group and show in the identity the extra value of the festival. 
Achievement: Complete visual identity, which is reflected in every piece of promotional materials. 
What I learned: Branding of the festival is about the vibe the identity will project and how it will affect people. And the devil is in the details. 

CrossCafe 
Redesign of the franchise of the Czech coffee shop  
Goal of the project: Separate visual identity from the competitors and create a new communication and corresponding branding   
Achievement: Coroful identity for the cafe, where customers can share their unique enjoyment and do what they want.  
What I learned: Separate the work between the teammate and me and let the other person's creative flow. 

Animations 

Favorite animal? MORJ!
My sandbox of creativity 
I have this personal passion project called MORJ, or Walrus. You can find my daily MORJ drawings on Instagram (@the.morj). I started this project on January 5th, 2020, and every day since then, I've posted a new MORJ. Each one is about different holidays, events, historical figures, countries, or everyday things.
Sometimes I experiment with animations related to MORJ. 
 My favorite MORJ from 2023 was posted on May 2nd. Can you spot it?
 
What I do in my free time
Apart from working late into the night and being a dedicated student during the day, I spend my free time drawing digitally or traditionally, depending on the mood. You might also find me at the gym, squatting 55 kg, or engrossed in manga.
