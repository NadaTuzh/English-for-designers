# Hi! 
### I'm Nadezda Tuzhilkina, but you can call me Naďa Tužilkina. 
I'm a Graphic designer and a Junior Art Director. I'm also the mother of MORJ!

**I believe Branding is like 'tailored' clothing.** Each project I take on is unique and tailored to match exactly what my clients need. Before diving into my projects, I love doing thorough research and analysis. It helps me come up with fresh, unique designs that take the visual aspect of my work to a whole new level.

## What I'm like as a person:
I consider myself an introvert in an extrovert's clothing because sometimes you want to have work done. And you need to call people from time to time. I am not afraid to go the extra mile if the effort pays off. 

About me in a few adjectives: creative, responsible, organized, communicative, and good at solving conflicts.

## What I can do:
- I'm familiar with both **Windows** and **macOS** operating systems.
- I work on graphics using **Adobe Suite** and **Affinity Suite**.
- I know how to create **2D animations using After Effects**.
- I collaborate with teams using **Figma** for projects.
- I'm getting the hang of using **Spline** and other **3D programs**.

I can speak Russian, Czech, and English fluently.

# What I do in my free time
Apart from working late into the night and being a dedicated student during the day, I spend my free time drawing digitally or traditionally, depending on the mood. You might also find me at the gym, squatting 55 kg, or engrossed in manga.
