Looking back on the past year, it feels like I've started to grow up.  I'm dealing with both good and tough times that have shaped my growth and perspective.

One big part of my year was getting into Dungeons and Dragons. Here I let my imagination run wild with character creation and fantasy scenarios. Even though I still struggle with understanding all the rules. I've gotten better at playing my Paladin character, which shows I'm getting the hang of it.

But it wasn't all smooth sailing.  I lost my job due to layoffs, which led to the company's downfall, which was a bitter pill to swallow.  At first, I took it personally  due to the attitude of management. but I've learned to only listen to criticism from those I truly respect and admire.  Rather than letting every opinion from higher-ups affect me.

After losing my job, I started working for myself.  This new chapter demanded figuring out how to deal with clients. Deciding how much to charge for my time. And managing my schedule. It's been tough, but it's also been rewarding to be in control of my work.

On a creative front, the development of our board game has been a source of excitement and ambition. We've been getting feedback from industry insiders in Albi. And this has spurred us to refine the rules and perfect the vision.  I am motivated to pour my heart and soul into this project. I'm working on this project with dreams of seeing our game on the shelves of stores. 

Academically, I worked on my thesis, which was hard but satisfying. I explored how erotic stores can stand out and attract customers. I've learned that it's better to do something really well, even if it's not perfect. Then to do nothing because of the fear of imperfection. I believe that my research offers fresh perspectives. It has the potential to redefine the brand in this unique sector.

In retrospect, this year is about the beginning of adulthood. About growing up and facing challenges. Through the highs and lows, I've learned a lot and become stronger.
