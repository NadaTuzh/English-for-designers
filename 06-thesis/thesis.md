 ## Introduction
In the bustling world of retail, differentiation is key. But for a chain of erotic stores like Erotic City, it’s not just about standing out—it’s about reinventing presence. This was the challenge tackled in my thesis. I aimed at redefining the brand identity and marketing strategies of Erotic City. With a desire to innovate the adult toy industry, my work dives into the deep of branding and visual communication.

The goal was ambitious yet clear: to reimagine Erotic City's branding to reflect its unique identity and enhance its market position. 

 ## Market Context and Challenges
In my thesis,  I focused on the deep study of the market to help create a new identity for Erotic City. First, I looked into what people currently think about Erotic City. This helped me understand where Erotic City stands in the market. I focused on who the customers are, what they like, and how they behave. This helped me figure out exactly who we should try to reach.

I made up detailed descriptions of the typical customers. These descriptions were based on data and research. The main part was to find out what most customers are like, what they need, and what they expect. This helped me understand the different types of customers better. Because of this, I could make design and marketing decisions more specific.

I also looked at what competitors of Erotic City are doing. I studied how they try to attract customers and their identities. By seeing what they do well and where they're not as strong, I could find ways for Erotic City to be different and better. This part of my study helped me figure out how Erotic City can stand out from others and be special.

This big market study was the main part of my work to help make a new and better image for Erotic City. We wanted to ensure it spoke to customers and made Erotic City stand out in a busy market.

 ## Branding Strategy - "Connection"
The new branding strategy for Erotic City presents the idea of "Connection."  It is the foundation for helping the brand succeed in the market. This concept reflects the target group's needs. The strategy connects rational and emotional worlds, which are inseparable in the erotic segment.

![Brand essence of new Erotic City Branding](https://nadatuzh.github.io/english-for-designers/06-thesis/img/filozofie-hodnoty.jpg)

Rational aspects include safety, guarantees, professionalism, and providing good services. The emotional side focuses on giving clients a unique experience related to sex and love.

![Emotional benefits of Erotic City](https://nadatuzh.github.io/english-for-designers/06-thesis/img/benefits-2.jpg)

The goal is to differentiate Erotic City from others by offering something extra. Something special that competitors cannot offer. The synergy of rational and emotional elements becomes a key factor in branding strategy.

With this strategy, Erotic City isn't just selling products; it becomes a trusted friend. It becomes the mentor for people who want to improve their personal experiences. This plan not only offers products but also experiences. It helps Erotic City stand out in the market and build community. 

 ## New Visual Identity
### Symbol and Logo 
The new look for Erotic City includes a special logo that shows what the brand is all about. I made a new symbol by linking two 'C's from "erotiC City". It looks like they mirror each other, which stands for a pair of people. This new design connects the feelings Erotic City brings to its customers.  Also looks like the 'E' from "Erotic," making it cool and fitting.

![Symbol design](https://nadatuzh.github.io/english-for-designers/06-thesis/img/logotyp-1.jpg)

In the typography, the flowing  Neulis font reflects the word "erotic". Neulis brings out the emotional side of the brand with its red color which means passion and energy. On the other hand, the word"City" is in the Neulis Alt font.  It looks calmer and steadier, and the purple color shows creativity and uniqueness. 

![Rebranded logotyp](https://nadatuzh.github.io/english-for-designers/06-thesis/img/logotyp-2.jpg)

This combination of fonts and colors represents the Erotic City's philosophy and values.

### Typography
When I was looking for a front for the new look for Erotic City, I wanted the style to be both fancy and modern. At first, I tried using serif fonts because they looked elegant and rich. But they felt too old-fashioned for what we wanted to be about modern sexuality. Then, I tried using plain, geometric sans-serif fonts that looked modern. But they didn't make people feel connected to the brand.

![Typography](https://nadatuzh.github.io/english-for-designers/06-thesis/img/pismo.jpg)

After thinking it over, I chose two fonts called Neulis and Neulis Alt. And they were just right. Neulis, made by Adam Ladd, is a modern font that makes words look beautiful and lively. It's easy to read and makes anything written with it look stylish. Neulis Alt, a different version of Neulis, is simpler and cleaner. It gives a professional look without being too fancy.

Using these two fonts together worked great. Neulis Alt brought a clear and logical feel, and Neulis brought warmth and style. This mix helped show the brand's personality in a way that made sense and felt right. It helped the brand talk to customers in a way that could be both straightforward and warm.

### Color
The new look for Erotic City has been changed to make it look nicer and more pleasing. We decided to change the colors of the brand to match what people like today, while still keeping it fancy. Before, the colors were yellow and red, which didn't fit with the brand's elegant style. After thinking about it a lot, we chose "Royal Purple" as the main color. It represents dignity and luxury. The color makes the brand stand out as very special and high-quality.

![Color pallete](https://nadatuzh.github.io/english-for-designers/06-thesis/img/barevnost-2.jpg)

We also thought about keeping the bright yellow color. Yellow is more iconic for Erotic City and works right symbolically.  But when we mixed it with purple, it was too bold and didn't match what the new philosophy. So, we chose red "Crimson Passion" to match the feelings of love and excitement that fit with the brand. Red works well with the calm royal purple. This mix of colors shows what Erotic City is all about, making it look good and making sense of the identity.

### Visual
The new identity of Erotic City has three main visual parts. These elements are noir photography, subtle illustrations of erotic toys and the human body, and the motif of resonance.

Noir photography is unique for its dramatic contrast, shadows, and often mysterious atmosphere. This style creates a strong visual language ideal for an erotic shop. The style captures sensuality, mystery, and an intimate feel essential for this market segment.  Evoking strong emotions and curiosity to attract customer attention and interest. Adding the brand's signature purple color to these photos adds a unique touch to the visual style.

Subtle illustrations use fine yet suggestive images.  It captures attention and sparks curiosity without crossing the line of good taste. Using these pictures helps create an atmosphere of mystery, intimacy, and sensuality. With elements, Erotic City can stand out from others. Connect with the target audience on a deeper emotional level.

The motif of resonance is the symbol of connection between partners. Using this idea in pictures creates emotional bonds Erotic City can provide. This builds up brand awareness as a brand that helps improve close relationships. This approach helps to create a deeper emotional relationship with the target audience.

## New Tone of Voice and Language 
When creating the new look and feel for Erotic City, I focused on making the way of speaking. The words should be kind and open while keeping a personal touch. Erotic City talks about sexuality with respect and seriousness.  So that customers feel safe and trust the brand. Erotic City is open to talking about sexuality, avoiding any unfair judgments. That helps the brand promote a healthy view of the topic. A personal touch helps to connect with customers, earning their trust and loyalty.

![Tone of Voice](https://nadatuzh.github.io/english-for-designers/06-thesis/img/tone-of-voice.jpg)

- Dignified - We talk about sex decently and without shame
- Open - We call things by their true names and be specific. We forget about hints and symbols.
- Unique - We are talking about individual needs, without generalizations. There is no universal advice for everyone.

I also created a special way of talking for Erotic City. The goal was to make the shopping experience unique and better. New words that show class and uniqueness. Showing that Erotic City is more than products; it’s about a way of life that values love and quality. These new words help the brand stand out from others. Build a stronger emotional bond with customers. And improve how people see the Erotic City. This way of talking helps the brand share beliefs and values better. It keeps current customers loyal and attracts new ones who want more from the shopping experience.

Examples terminology:
- "Boutique" to indicate branches,
- "Advisory Center" for customer support,
- "Erotic City Club" as a loyalty program,
- "Limited Edition" for special offers,
- "Specialist" for limited cooperation with experts,
- "Advisor" for employees at branches

## Innovative Marketing Strategies
In the last part of my thesis, I worked on creating a strategy for Erotic City, a store that sells adult products. The goal was to make Erotic City better by combining emotional with rational aspects. And making the shopping experience about more than just buying things.

Here's a breakdown of the main ideas from my strategy:

### Telling a Story About the Brand. 
The plan centered around a strong story spreading through all marketing channels. From in-store to social media. This story linked emotions with usefulness. Creates a sense of community and trust between the brand and its customers.

### Making the Store Welcoming. 
The plan of design of the stores focuses on creating the feeling of comfort and welcoming.  With specific lights and  brand colors, the goal was to make a space that not only helps shopping. But also makes customers feel secure and valued.

### Working with Specialists. 
Erotic City collaborates with experts and educates its workers.  The brand holds special events and workshops in the stores to give extra value to its customers.  Providing the space for conversation Erotic City connects customers and specialists. Also, some events focus on products more, creating a place for offline exchange.

### Rewards and Community.
Erotic City Club is a loyalty program to reward customers. The goal is not just to buy things but to be active with the brand online and offline. This builds a community around Erotic City, keeps customers coming back, and spreads positive words.

### Social Media and Community. 
The strategy included a strong online presence, especially on social media. Content focuses on the needs and specifics of each social media with the target audience. Instagram builds brand awareness being a neutral ground for the content. LinkedIn shows the behind-the-scenes of the adult toys industry, providing more information. YouTube provides space for educational and entertainment videos, whereas the brand is a sponsor.

The strategy focuses on engaging customers through platforms like social media and forums. By adding X the brand can communicate with its audience and create community. The forum on Erotic City's website encourages customers to have an open conversation.  By receiving rewards for reviews, customers strengthen brand loyalty and public perception.
