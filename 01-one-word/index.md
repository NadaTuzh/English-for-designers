## Do you ever have a conversation with your colleague/classmate or just friend something like this: 
## “Hey, did you send me the visual we had agreed on? The client is already asking”
## “Oh, my bad.” 

This. This situation boils my blood and lowers the chances of the person ever working with me again. "My bad" is increasingly used as a shield against genuine accountability. 

I first encountered "my bad'' during my high school years, and it wasn't in a context that one might expect. It was a “cool” teenage word. And as a teenager, you usually use words because they just surround you. Peer pressure. We all have been there. 

Initially, I found it somehow amusing. It was a convenient way to diffuse tense situations with humour, and it lightened the mood. However, as time passed, I noticed a disturbing trend among my generation. 
It wasn't in the midst of a heartfelt apology or as a way to accept responsibility for a mistake. Instead, it was often used flippantly, dismissively, and even mockingly. In my circle of friends, it became a common refrain whenever someone did something thoughtless, careless, or even hurtful. It was as if those two words could magically absolve someone of any wrongdoing.

This casual approach to accountability started to seep into my own behaviour. I found myself using "my bad" as a defence mechanism, a way to avoid confronting my own shortcomings and apologising when I genuinely should have. It became a reflex, a habit that allowed me to save face without addressing the root of the problem.

One particular incident stands out in my memory. I had neglected to fulfil a promise I'd made to a close friend. When she confronted me, I instinctively responded with "my bad" and a laugh, as if it were no big deal. My friend's hurt and disappointment were palpable, and my cavalier response only added salt to the wound. In that moment, I realised the harm that "my bad" was causing, not only in my interactions with others but in my own personal growth. 

The phrase had, in essence, become a crutch for avoiding genuine self-reflection and emotional growth. It was an easy way out, a shortcut around the discomfort of admitting my faults and working to make amends. I recognized that by using "my bad" so carelessly, I was not only failing to take responsibility for my actions but also diminishing the significance of sincere apologies and the process of personal growth.

As I reflected on the impact of those two seemingly innocuous words, I realised the importance of genuine apologies. Apologies should be heartfelt, a recognition of the pain we may have caused others. "My bad" had stripped that depth and sincerity from my apologies, reducing them to hollow words that held no weight.

"My bad" became a personal mantra, a constant reminder that every action bears weight, and every mistake has consequences. It taught me the irreplaceable value of integrity and the irrevocable cost of carelessness. While it may have left a bitter taste in my mouth, the phrase served as a catalyst for my personal growth, urging me to strive for excellence and never to undermine the significance of accountability.
