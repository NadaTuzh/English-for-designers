**"My Bad"** - Two Simple Words That Can Make You Feel Good or Bad - Words can make us feel different emotions.

**First Time Hearing** - in high school, but not when people were saying sorry.

**Using "My Bad" in a Funny Way** - as jokes and lighten the mood when something went wrong.

**A Strange Thing Happened** - But then, people started using "my bad" to avoid saying sorry when they did something wrong.

**It Hurt People's Feelings** - People started using "my bad" instead of saying sorry, and it hurt others' feelings.

**Habit** - I started using "my bad" too, to protect myself and not have to admit I did something wrong.

**A Big Problem** - One day, I didn't keep a promise to a friend, and when she asked about it, I just said "my bad." It hurt her feelings, and I realized something was wrong.

**Stopped Me from Growing** - made me avoid saying sorry when I should.

**Real Apologies Are Important** - "My bad" doesn't work as a real apology.

**Learning and Growing** - It taught me to be honest and not use excuses.
