# Gain Perspective: Step Back
As a creative soul, art has always drawn me. Creativity has shaped who I am. From sketching to exploring various forms of expression. Along this journey, I've learned a valuable lesson that I want to share with you.

Traditional drawing, a fundamental aspect of art education, often felt tedious. Spending hours drawing figures or scenes tested my patience. Despite my efforts, there were times when my work fell short. Perspective skewed, details overemphasized. It was during these moments that my teacher taught me to step back. By creating distance, I gained a broader view, allowing me to reassess and adjust my approach.

This concept of stepping back applies beyond art. In my early tennis days, technique took a backseat to enjoyment. It wasn't until a new coach emphasized the importance of space between player and ball. Since then my game improved. Stepping back offered clarity and refined my approach, enhancing my performance.

The metaphorical "space" between ourselves and our endeavors holds significance. It provides a pause for reflection and offers a fresh perspective. Whether in career or personal challenges, stepping back allows for clarity and growth.

Stepping back serves as a reminder to avoid tunnel vision and embrace perspective. 

So, sometimes you navigate life's complexities. All you need is to remember the importance of taking that crucial step away. For therein lies clarity and growth.
