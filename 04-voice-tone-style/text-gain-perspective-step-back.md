# Gain Perspective: Step Back
As an artist, the creative spark has always pulled me towards it. It's shaped me, from early sketches to exploring different forms of expression. But on this journey, there's one crucial lesson I've learned. It goes beyond the art world.

Remember those traditional drawing classes where hours passed by on figures and scenes? It could feel like a slog, testing your patience. No matter how hard I tried, sometimes my work wasn't right. The perspective was off, and the details were overwhelming. That's when my teacher introduced the power of stepping back. Taking that physical distance gave me a broader view. It allowed me to see my work with fresh eyes and make adjustments.

This concept of stepping back isn't about art. In my early days of tennis, I focused on having fun, neglecting proper technique. Then, a new coach showed the importance of "space" between the player and the ball. That one change transformed my game. Stepping back allowed me to refine my approach, boosting my performance.

This metaphorical "space" between ourselves and what we do is valuable. It's a reminder to break free from tunnel vision and embrace a broader view. It's a pause for reflection. So next time you're feeling stuck, remember the power of taking a step away. It's where you'll find the space to find clarity and pave the way for growth.
